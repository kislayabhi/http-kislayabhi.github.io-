This happens to be the one thing that puts me into conflicts a lot these days. A conflict that is within me and is against myself.

If I see someone present his/her point, I try to find several inconsistencies in them. I then try to correct them on their these points.

If inconsistencies are there due to their pure ignorance then this approach may work, but most of the time this is not the case.

That person has a perspective which is different than me. All I can do is share my perspective and it is upon him/her to accept it or not. If he/she thinks I am ignorant of certain facts, then again he/she should point to them and I should clarify but other than that, the acceptance and agreement of any idea is personal and cannot be forced upon.

As they say, nothing is right or wrong ... but not doing something which you think at the current moment as right is wrong.
