I have moved on from Wordpress to here as I found myself very cluttered in that place. Github appears more like a cozy and homely place to reside! :)



It had been quite a day today. I fought myself over setting up this blog as a place to write off my mental ramblings. I hope I stick to this one though.

Anyways, the earth shattering news of Kalam's expiry yesterday while giving his IIM Shillong lecture took me into a state of oblivion of some sorts, that I refused to believe if it's really true.

I will write a lot more though. I have to actually. It is required for us to understand what he really wanted to achieve and where are we going.
