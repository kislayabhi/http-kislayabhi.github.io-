<p>I had been trying hard to get accustomed with the OpenGM library so that I get to understand what are the things that I will be needing for my implementation of Approximate algorithms.</p>

<p>I will jot down my findings here:</p>
<p>Below is the most important image that will help me to write off things quite cleanly.</p>

<p>The things that are needed by the OpenGM for completely specifying the above factor model are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The number of variables along with cardinality (the number of labels) of each of these. This is done by constructing an object called an <strong>Label Space.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Functions </strong>describe the different small $latex \varphi_i$ that are used to decompose the bigger $latex \varphi$.</li>
<li><strong>Operations </strong>can be addition, multiplication, max and min. These are the operations through which the $latex \varphi$ decomposes into $latex \varphi_i$.</li>
<li><strong>Factors </strong>is the only missing link which connects the appropriate $latex \varphi$ with respective $latex x_v's$ intended as the inputs.</li>
</ol>

<p>The above one was a very primitive model. Let us make from a complete one like present below:</p>
