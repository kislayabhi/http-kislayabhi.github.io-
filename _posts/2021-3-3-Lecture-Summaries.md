De-Superimposition - Snake and Rope

Rope is the cause and the effect is the snake
Brahman is the cause and the effect is this universe

Apavad: It negates the effect. What you considered to be universe -- there is no universe. It is negating the effect. It is not real. Negation here means that only cause is the there and not the effect. The effect is thus negated. When you negate the "karyam", the cause's causality is lost. There is no snake, only the rope is there. If the effect, the snake is not there, then why are you calling the rope a cause? Indeed it is only the rope through and through. Thus it is Brahman and Brahman alone. But what happens here is that, the poor God has been lost here which is the cause of the Universe.

Parinam (Actual transformation: Real change happens from cause to effect): Seed (cause) --> Sapling (effect); Milk --> Curd.
Vivarta (Apparent transformation: Not a real transformation): Desert --> Mirage; Mind --> Dream-world; Screen --> Movie-story; Rope --> Snake.

If there is no actual transformation, then by knowledge one can get back to the effect from the cause. But that is not possible with an actual transformation. Knowing that the movie is a just a movie, one enjoys the tragedies and climax of the movie because one knows the reality is just a screen. Knowledge can take one from effect to cause which is Vivarta.

Paramarthika; Absolute --> Brahman. Really real.
Vyavaharika (Transactional); This waking world.
Prathibhasika; apparent world of errors delusions etc.

Rope --> Vyavharika
Snake --> Prathibhasika

In Parinama, the cause and effect are on the same level of reality. The cause actually turns into effect in reality. The dualistic schools have a view where Brahman existed in the beginning and then it became the world.
In Vivarta, the cause is on a higher level of reality. The cause appeare as something else, but not in reality.

because this universe is a vivarta of universe, Brahman is on a higher level of reality. And its appeareacen -- this world is a vyavhaharika satya. Thus these two apparent levels can be dissolved by the correction effected by Knowledge. This realization of the effect that it is nothing but the cause -- it is possible only for the vivarta. If it had been a real world, then no amount of vedantic enquiry will help a person. By knowledge one can become free.

The BrahmaSutra starts with "Hence therefore an enquiry into Brahman." What does an enquiry do? It generated Knowledge. How will that help. If you enquire into Brahman, the knowledge of Brahman will set you free from suffering. The knowledge of Brahman comes from an enquiry into Brahman. When you open the box, the assumption inside is that the Samsara is a vivarta of Brahman. 

The snake, which is a vivarta of rope, which means it is rope only. Entire universe going back to Maya is appearing. Brahman is the only reality. Snake remains as nothing other than rope. Brahman looks like the world. The unenlightened person thinks of them as good and bad person etc. But an enlightened person knows that it is Brahman only. Swami Vivekananda says that the world is inert in itself but we breathe life into it.

Verse 139: Evreything we see here in the physical universe is nothing but matter -- 5 elements (Akasha, Fire, Earth, Wind, Water). Four kinds of bodies -- what do we experience from these bodies (enjoyment and sufferings) -- The entire multiverse with galaxies, super-strings, planets -- can be just summarized into 5 elements. This itself removes all of our problems. My physical body and coronavirus -- they are on the same level. Panca-Bhuta -- Pra-Panca.

Verse 140: All these 5 elements which makes this physical world + 17(or 19) subtle parts = 5 subtle elements = panca subtle elements (Akasha, Wind, Fire, Earth, Water). Form is the property of fire element. Sound is the property of the Space element. So the next stop, we have the 5 subtle elements. These things can actually be experienced. Swami SarvagatanandaJi went to his guru Swami Akhandanandaji and had taken Mantra Deeksha earlier through him. After sometime Swami Akhandanandaji asked him -- what do you see.  Physical universe becomes ideas. And next when asked he said, it is all consciousness.

Verse 141: The five subtle elements together with Satva, Rajas, Tamas are nothing but maya with Brahman. Maya + Brahman == God. Agnana Upahita Chitanyam.

Verse 142: This Ishwara is nothing other than the Ultimate Reality except Maya. Consciousness not associated with Maya == Turiyam. Turiya is the ultimate reality -- Unlimited Existence-Consciousness-Bliss which is You!

This is the end of superimposition and desuperimposition. Now starts Vedanta. That Thou Art! Now we are ready to understand the REAL VEDANTA as we now dive into understanding what it means when it is said -- "That thou art".


### Geeta: Wed March 5 2021

New lightning arrangements. Which made the Swami happy :)
The lecture tomorrow by Prof. Timalsena -- on Drishti Srishti Vada. Pretty difficult subject - a strand of thought in Advaita Vedanta.

It is safer to be a householder..you though have no choice over Spiritual practises. Karma, Upasana and Gnana.
Advaita vedanta is queer in this way, vacaspati mishra points that our in his Bhamti school books:
1. Where one has to go somewhere to find something
2. vs not by doing anything, the necklace that is on my neck -- which never have been lost by us. But we feel its lost and we look elsewhere. And then somebody has to point that it is already there with you. It was a mistake. Mistake can never be corrected by work, rather Knowledge. Once a person becomes aware of one's Divine Nature, one's Divine Awareness -- that is spirituality as per Advaita Vedanta.

it is important to point this out as other spiritual means says doing something and you something. but then A.v says doing something is important to create suitable conditions to receive knowledge. The four fold qualifications and treasures, the most important thing being intense desire of Freedom. Right now the intense desire is there but it is scattered all over in the world. It is scattered over husband, wife, facebook friends, money etc. My desire has been scattered over hundreds of things. We all want it -- since we are all here -- but not totally. We want it somewhat, and that is why.

Sri Krishna says to Arjuna that this desire that is scattered all over the place has to be gathered via karma yoga (Puja at the physical level, one should convert their daily activities in some kind of worship, karma yoga at the verbal level would be -- chanting of hymns etc, then upasana -- mental meditation, Japa -- all of this doing physically mentally verbally -- creates conditions for enlightenement.) After some time this whole project of God Realization will become very serious. And other things will start taking 2nd role then.

Sri Krishna says in 12th verse -- The person who practises Karma yoga in this way --- who is not pursuing the objects of desire in the world -- five levels of peace of mind -- 1st of all by making our lives ethical -- 2nd level then not only a clean life but also an unselfish life -- then 3rd level, not only I am living an unselfish life, the internal thoughts are about God and not the world. Swami Suhitananda ji told him once that when he was the attendent of swami Premeshanandaji; one day S.P was lying ill and resting in bed. And S.S asked him just like that -- swami what are you thinking about now and he replied the sarva-vyapi-sri-ramakrishna. -- the 4th level when one transcends the mind. you don't need mind all the time -- atleast twice a day. You have mouth and do you keep eating all the time. You can shut down the mind twice a day and you can extract unthinkable peace. This takes long years of practise -- the 5th level is the final, Brahman is itself peace.

In contrast to this one if one is not worshipful and is acting out of anxiety and habit -- all propelled by desire -- that person who is not practise karma yoga -- one has to work -- you can;t stop work -- married people will have to work in the household -- one who does simply karma propelled by desire -- they are caught in samsara -- those who are free from it -- they get upto 3 levels of peace of mind. But the last level of mind, He is going to talk about it below:

Verse 13th

The path of knowledge: Once my mind has gotten the requisite preparations then I study the prakaran texts -- then I come to realization -- you don't really know what you are. Right now what we know ourselves to be is this body mind. I know myself to this body. I am the mind embodied in the body. Once you come to vedanta -- by various means -- drg drishya viveka -- 5 sheaths -- waking-dreaming-deepsleep. Know the I is not what it was thought. The real I is the one big sun high up in the sky. You are not this little body, this little mind, this little awareness embodies -- instead you are this Awareness in which mind and body and universe is shining through. The real meaning of I is Brahman, Satchidananda. Take the movie example -- one a movie screen the whole movie goes on it. There is a hero, a villain, a comedy, a tragedy is going on. All there is -- is the movie screen. In everything there is the same screen. Till now the screen has forgotten itself, and has identified with one character in the screen. Now you are being told that you are not this character but the screen on which the movie is being played.

This means you are not a physical entity, not born, doesn't get old as the characters in the movie get older, I don't age with the aging of the body, I don't get diseased with the diseaseof the body, I am not affected by the death of the body -- suppose it is a tragedy -- then does the screen die? Absolutely NOT! None of us are going to be die. We are all IMMORTAL! How is something terrable when one has done something 1000 times before. Similarly, with the personality in the movie -- some are happy, sad, angry -- does the screen has any changes? no. It remain the same.

Swami Yogeshanandaji -- 6 lighted windows -- swami madhvananda -- birth control -- by enlightenment -- How can the screen be born? The screen is not affected by anything that happens to characters -- neither good nor bad. Not only that-- it is the same screen behind all of the characters. The enlightened screen sees all the characters depends upon me. the most beloved person -- they will never be separated from them. Vedanta says that you will never be separated from your father, mother, friends etc. but this also means that the character you don't like -- he is also one with you. Swamiji says -- praiser praise blamer blamed -- all are one.

The whole universe depends on you, the screen, The screen can exist without the movie but the movie is dependent upon you. Any kind of movie can be played or no movie is being played. This is the meaning of Aham Brahmashmi. This is something Sri Krisha assumes as per the 2nd chapter. Till now all the work has been done in the spirit of krma yoga. But now that oyu have ralized thar you are screen, then screen can't do anything -- but depending on the screen the hero is driving the car. Depending on you the body mind is working and doing its activity. you are this body and mind, the food itself is nothing apart fgrom you, the person who is being offered is also nothing but you. The earlier understanding was -- now I am the screen and all the activities in the movie -- I lend them existence and awareness. No movie can play without the screen, I give existence and consciousness -- in that sense Consciousness can't do any thing. it is the body-mind which does things. screen real -- movie apperance == Brahaman satyam -- Jagat Appearance. All activities will continue -- the body and mind will continue as in the movie -- it might be acting/not-acting/movie/monk/householder -- I am now acting through all other people.

Now what happens -- giving up all the activities by the mind -- by the understanding-- at first i thought i was driving the car -- now I see the whole movie is appearing in me the Cons. I am not acting. This understanding is called -- this is the giving up of activities. Not actually stoppnig the car. But change the level -- it is just light and pictures. Physical and mental and verbal activity -- giving it up by knowledge -- but the body will drive, mind will think and meditate -- now you can enjoy the movie better. 

The enligtened mind relaxes and lives happily -- finds great peace -- the 5th level of peace -- where? in this 9 gated city --the body. So 9 gates by which we interact with the world -- in this body itself you are there. in the movie, where is the screnn? It is right there. In this body and mind, the Atman is there -- relaxed and happy. Let this little person do its job -- You just remain happy. Advaita vedanta doesn't ask one to run to himalayan cave -- swamiji says that he who runs away or he who plunges into vanities of life -- they both have missed the way. The right 3rd way is to divinize life itself. Someone tells you these ornaments are not real but find the Gold. Someone throws away the ornament and runs to himalayan or someone grabs the necklace and try enjoying the vanities of life -- then both are in trouble -- but rather one who see in all activities Brahman alone -- in the midst of life itself is sukham and relaxed and happy -- advaita pratiti ko hataney key liye nahi hai -- it is not demanding that you have to swithc off the movie -- now you are realizing that you are always there, you are not at all fazed by this , Nirbaadh -- you can be in the midst of intense activity - in an aashram or in a mountain cave -- this is possible in Advaita Vedanta -- happily -- sign of enlightenement -- no grumbling -- job problem, family problem -- all in the movie but not in screen. You are screen, you are Brahman -- "Some says I understand Advaita Vedanta but I have this and that problem --" how can that be possible! If you are screen, how come prolems of movie are your problems!! If you ask an Enlightened person which is the best time of you life -- he will say NOW. Which is the best place you have been in your life -- he will say HERE. 


Then the Sw Ramakrishnanandaji's story .. let the Lord play with this little person as He wills -- no problems with me. In themidst of the active life, you do nothing. But are you making thebody-mind act? NO! The screen is not making the hero drive the car? no. Aham Brahmasmi -- the highest level of peace.



Verse 14th-15th

You are as Brahman not the Karta -- nor the Bhokta. The agent of the action -- the doer of the action -- and bhokta the enjoyer of the pleasure or pain.

If the screen is not forcing the movie to run -- then who is making it play -- by its own swabhava -- maya. Beginningless Ignorance.


--- qna --
* The three robber story -- sattva rajas tamas. tamas is the 1st robber(destroys a person), the 2nd robber is rajas() and the 3rd robber is sattva(takes till reality but no further as it is also a robber). 
* screen doesn't seem blissful? The one watches the movie, who is free of the movie -- that only enjoys the movie -- the aesthetic enjoyment comes from free of danger -- that which is the infinite is the true happiness -- everythhing in the movie is limited -- every character occupies a very limited part in the movie -- but screen is everywhere in the movie, in every person , in every object -- that unlimited nature is Bliss itself.
* The value of Present -- it gets value because of Brahman.
* The Real you and your nature. Swarup and swabhava, The same light coming from the stained light widnow -- ti si not the light is different -- it just has been filtered through the different conditioning of th emind that it has picked up in various lifes. We are all the same Consciousness -- The real nature of everybody is the screen.. Is Hitler is the embodiment of evil and Mother Teresa a saintly -- are they the same? say someone asks? I am not denying the evil or saintlyness -- they are in the personality -- swabhava but not swaroop.
* Think gboaut deep sleep in th emovie example -- whatever is not there when the miviue is switched off -- the fact is the screen was there and also here when the movie is being played. Swabhava belongs to maya -- in a seed form.
* If you van see youself apart from the body and rest in cons. relax in the cons. step back from the body and relax. then you will attain permanent happiness. Right now right now. No need to go anywhere. You will be free of all -- by just this one step itself -- just relax back -- that is it. Atman is like your favourite Pillow where you relax after a day's of work. You are Brahman -- relax back. 
* Once we ask sw ranganathanandaji -- he tried to explain -- he said it is right here. It is underlying -- is the reality of body-movie. Just like screen is underlying the movie, the reality of the movie..
* The very nature of the Brahman, the svabhava is to keep the movie ongoing.
* Question: "The movie is necessary in order for us to gain enlightenment." --> Two truths taught by the  Buddha. Without taking the help of the relative truth, one can't go to the Absolute Truth. Movie is very important to Enlightenment.
* Person - the connection between the reality and power. Freedom of will is an oxymoron -- it is in causation.
