De-Superimposition - Snake and Rope

Rope is the cause and the effect is the snake
Brahman is the cause and the effect is this universe

Apavad: It negates the effect. What you considered to be universe -- there is no universe. It is negating the effect. It is not real. Negation here means that only cause is the there and not the effect. The effect is thus negated. When you negate the "karyam", the cause's causality is lost. There is no snake, only the rope is there. If the effect, the snake is not there, then why are you calling the rope a cause? Indeed it is only the rope through and through. Thus it is Brahman and Brahman alone. But what happens here is that, the poor God has been lost here which is the cause of the Universe.

Parinam (Actual transformation: Real change happens from cause to effect): Seed (cause) --> Sapling (effect); Milk --> Curd.
Vivarta (Apparent transformation: Not a real transformation): Desert --> Mirage; Mind --> Dream-world; Screen --> Movie-story; Rope --> Snake.

If there is no actual transformation, then by knowledge one can get back to the effect from the cause. But that is not possible with an actual transformation. Knowing that the movie is a just a movie, one enjoys the tragedies and climax of the movie because one knows the reality is just a screen. Knowledge can take one from effect to cause which is Vivarta.

Paramarthika; Absolute --> Brahman. Really real.
Vyavaharika (Transactional); This waking world.
Prathibhasika; apparent world of errors delusions etc.

Rope --> vyavharika
Snake --> Prathibhasika

In Parinama, the cause and effect are on the same level of reality.
In Vivarta, the cause is on a higher level of reality.

because this universe is a vivarta of universe, Brahman is on a higher level of reality. And its appeareacen -- this world is a vyavhaharika satya. Thus these two apparent levels can be dissolved by the correction effected by Knowledge. This realization of the effect that it is nothing but the cause -- it is possible only for the vivarta. If it had been a real world, then no amount of vedantic enquiry will help a person. By knowledge one can become free.


The BrahmaSutra starts with "Hence therefore an enquiry into Brahman." What does an enquiry do? It generated Knowledge. How will that help. If you enquire into Brahman, the knowledge of Brahman will set you free from suffering. The knowledge of Brahman comes from an enquiry into Brahman. When you open the box, the assumption inside is that the Samsara is a vivarta of Brahman. 

The snake, which is a vivarta of rope, which means it is rope only. Entire universe going back to Maya is appearing. Brahman is the only reality. Snake remains as nothing other than rope. Brahman looks like the world. The unenlightened person thinks of them as good and bad person etc. But an enlightened person knows that it is Brahman only. Swami Vivekananda says that the world is inert in itself but we breathe life into it.
