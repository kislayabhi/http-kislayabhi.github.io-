<p>For last 3 months,  me and my two other friends  worked hard for this event. We needed to provide our juniors a platform from where they can learn. The gluttony of the events held presently in Prastuti always made me sad. To get over all these things, we brought Perceptron.</p>

<p><a title="Perceptron event page" href="http://www.iitbhu.ac.in/prastuti/perceptron" target="_blank">Perceptron </a>is a event based on Computer Vision. The aim of this event is to develop a Face detection framework from a scratch in matlab . We used the paper of<a title=" Research Paper" href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=990517&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D990517" target="_blank"> Viola and Jones</a> for reference. It took us 4  workshops to present the overview of the system to a audience who had no previous knowledge about machine learning or image processing!! Personally I think, we may went just too harsh on them. Nevertheless, there were 24 students who sticked till the final day of the event.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The whole procedure looked something like this:</p>
<ol>
