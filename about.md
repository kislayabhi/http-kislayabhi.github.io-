Hey there!

I am Abhijeet. Nice to see you.
I currently work as a Software developer in Bloomberg LP in New York city.
This blog is about the musings that occur to me on a daily basis. I initially started with Wordpress, then a little bit of personal diary, then Quora and other places. I hope to compile everything together at one place here.  

Also, I will continue to write few technical articles I am learning along the way to keep this blog interesting.
Who wants to read boring rants on the Society anyways? haha

Have a great time mate!
